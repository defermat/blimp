Blimp is a mechanism to easily move a container from one Docker host to another, show containers running against all of your hosts, replicate a container across multiple hosts and more. It relies on a proposed feature for docker (gh#8681) that @nathanleclaire spoke about during the October 2014 Global Hackathon. Leveraging the ability to connect to multiple hosts, we built a tool around that to manage containers across those connected hosts. Functions like `ls`, `move`, `replicate`, `start`, and `stop` in the context of a container are possible across hosts of various providers.
