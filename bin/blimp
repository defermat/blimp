# Assumptions:
#   docker is running -dev w/ the `hosts` command available
#
#   All docker hosts attached are pointing to the same registry, and
#   that the original container was booted from an image there
#
#   You are running this from the directory where blimp exists; need to
#   fix library paths in a better way
#
# To do:
# 
#   address dupe container name possibility, take container ids...
#   does not react well if a host is down
#   set active host back to what it was prior to run ?
