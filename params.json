In most cases it works just fine if you tell it to \"go figure it out yourself.\" Once configured you will see a cpan> shell prompt.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you should do is to upgrade your CPAN:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncpan> install Bundle::CPAN\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce ready, type:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncpan> reload cpan\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it is time to install the additional modules you need. In this case the JSON module:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncpan> install JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf needed you will be prompted to install other modules this module depends on.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
